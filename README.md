Virtual Instances Generator

This repository contains the source code for the generator used in the NPD benchmark (https://github.com/ontop/npd-benchmark).

The generator is bundled as a multi-module maven (http://maven.apache.org/) project.

Build and JAR
----
VIG is bundled as a maven project, therefore it can be built using the standard maven commands. In order to save time, there is a build script that does the job as well.

$ ./build.sh
